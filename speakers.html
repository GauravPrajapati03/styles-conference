                    <h5>Heavy Metal Coding</h5>
                    <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in
                        addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm of learning – both of code and drum beats! You’ll
                        learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner’s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a
                        marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven
                        shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>

                        other web technologies, and gives occasional tech talks at conferences and universities.</p>
